PROJECT TITLE: Emotions
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: TO incorporate emotions and combine music and animation
VERSION or DATE:5/11/16
DEPENDENCIES:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS:Ryan Fang. Java stack Overflow
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Run the main Method on the everything class. 
My main goal was to try to incorporate music and animation, which is what I did. I'm happy with the output for the time I allotted. Although, there is still a lot of work to do. 
I was only able to create one emotion and sound. Though I feel the main thing that was stalling my progress was the git hub and the sound.
I wasn't able to access any sound files online at school, and I couldn't access my program at home, because my github didn't work. I was able the visuals in drawing editor lab. 
I learned toggle button. I learned a lot with sound as well. The main learning I had with sound was the file navigation. I did use a lot of the code from Stack overflow. 
Though the code wasn't exactly the same, because in their example they used a URl.

I learned how to play the sound. Though I think the end product is really cool. 
I'm sorry I lost all my commits and progress. Though there is no evidence for it, I did continue to work on the project the whole time. 
I spent a long time trying to get the class diagrams right. Then I spent a while configuring exactly how I wanted my design to look. 
Though I wanted to move on to sound. I wasn't able to so I added more colors and designs to my program. The code runs smoothly. 
The last new thing I learned was probably timer and clock. The timer method really made my animation much simpler.
